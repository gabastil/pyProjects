# Name: 	HTMLStripper.py
# Version: 	1.0.0
# Author: 	Glenn Abastillas
# Date: 	March 08, 2016
#
# Purpose: Allows the user to:
#           1.) Navigate a folder and its subfolders to load files intended for HTML mark-up removal
#			2.) Remove HTML mark-up with native HTMLParser class from each file encountered
#			3.) Save all documents with HTML mark-up removed into an 'output' folder in the save directory as the files
#
# To see the script run, go to the bottom of this page. 
#
# This class is not directly inherited by any other class.
#
# Updates:
# 1. [2016/03/10] - added documentation for all methods. Moved convert method out of the scripting pathway. Added HTMLStripperObject and LoopDirObject parameters to convert method.
# 2. [2016/03/11] - added clear_tabs() and is_blank() methods for use in strip_tags() for-loop.
# 3. [2016/03/11] - simplified generators to a single generator using methods added in update 2. Checked generator run time versus expanded for-loop (generator runs ~1.12x faster).

"""	load files from a directory for HTML mark-up removal.

Using the built-in Python HTMLParser package, text data with HTML mark-up is fed into the HTMLParser class's feed method, which removes the mark-up. Post-processing is applied to remove extraneous empty lines and leading tabs.

This class searches the specified directory and its sub-directories entirely for all text files regardless of their HTML mark-up content and processes them. If a document has no HTML mark-up, then it simply passes through the post-processing stage.

To use this class as a script, simply change the variable (i.e., f1) pointing to the directory in the scripting section and run the script. A new 'output' folder will be created where the documents with HTML mark-up are found and the processed files are then saved at that location.
